# MySensors Project Template

This project aims to serve as a base template for publishing your [MySensors](https://www.mysensors.org/) project on GitHub and get it automatically grabbed and published on [OpenHardware.io](https://www.openhardware.io/)

Please read the [documentation](description.md), for more information.

We're currently discussing it at [MySensors forums](http://forum.mysensors.org/topic/2915/rfc-lazy-submission-to-openhardware-io-using-github).
